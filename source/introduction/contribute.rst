Road Map
********


First, It is born now.

Terradoo Cloud is a very big Project, and need time to grow up, it depends of the Community Development.

This time also depends directily of each Technology that Support Terrado Cloud.

Each Technology is Complex and Big, and Integrate all together also is Complex.


First Steps
***********

Choose right Technologies and Solutions with Proofs of Concept ( PoC ).

Beginning with Google provider and try to set up all sizes Solutions.

To avoid lock-in provider, I'll try to use all possible Open Source Solutions.

But, I'll build a Solution with GCP Services as PoC, and for who want GCP integrated Solution.
